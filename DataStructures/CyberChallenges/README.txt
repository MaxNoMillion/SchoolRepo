You will need to register your team again for this challenge. Remember ONLY ONE MEMBER OF THE TEAM NEEDS TO DO THIS. Open a Git Bash shell window inside this folder and type the following on the command line:

java RegisterTeam TEAMNAME

Replace 'TEAMNAME' with your team's name

When you run this, a file called "team.data" is created. Leave this file in this folder and share it with your team. They will also need to have the file inside this folder.

When you have done this, go inside of the DataStructures folder and read the README file in there.
